Donor Finding System

The Donor Finding System is a web-based platform developed to support disaster management authorities and healthcare providers in rapidly identifying and contacting eligible blood donors during emergency scenarios. By digitizing and automating the donor search and alert process, the system aims to reduce critical response times and improve overall efficiency in blood collection and distribution during crises.

🔧 Key Features
✅ Donor registration with blood group, location, and availability

📍 Real-time donor-patient matching based on location and compatibility

🚨 Emergency request broadcasting to nearby donors

📊 Admin dashboard to manage users and monitor system activity

🛠️ Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Additional Tools: Location-based filtering, basic authentication
API's : Openstreetmap API

📘 Project Background
This system was developed as part of my final year undergraduate project in Computer Science. The primary objective was to create a practical solution for real-world challenges in emergency blood donation coordination, especially in disaster-affected regions.
